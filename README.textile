h1. Chocolate Meat Mephisto Theme

For a demo of this theme check out "The EZPZ Way":http://theezpzway.com/2009/3/8/chocolate-meat-mephisto-theme.

What is chocolate meat?  Not only is it a delicious Filipino dish it is now also a Mephisto theme!  For blogging developers, it uses a modified version of the "lazy" TextMate syntax highlighting theme (via Ultraviolet).

Tried and tested on Mephisto 0.8.  Anything else is unknown territory.
